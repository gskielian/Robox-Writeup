Robox-Writeup
=============

The Robox respository, it's a basic curriculum for introducing kids to coding and robotics using Arduino's, protoboards, and economic parts.  The SF's ROCK Beacon afterschool program in Visitacion Valley hosts a robotics activity where 10+ students (6th and 7th graders) build and program their robots to achieve various tasks (basic courier bots, patrolling robots, snack-serving robots, etc).  I collaborated on this project with Nicky Ringland of the Girls Programming Network program in Sydney University.  There, she held workshops for local teachers to learn  how to build these to teach their high school students stem topics using this economic robotics platform (I have open-sourced the parts list and the price is currently $30 for the mobile platform with the ultrasonic sensor and all the cables).
