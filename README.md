Robox-Writeup
=============

I'm going to use this folder to write and organize open-curriculum for Robox: our goal is to introducing students to coding and robotics using Arduino's, protoboards, and sensors.  

The SF's ROCK Beacon afterschool program in Visitacion Valley hosts a robotics activity where 10+ students (6th and 7th graders) are building and programming their robots to achieve various tasks: creating courier bots, patrolling robots, snack-serving robots, and telepresence robots.
